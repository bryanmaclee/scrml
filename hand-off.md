# scrmlTS — Session 199 (CLOSE — WRAPPED via the FIRST live baton-pass)

**Date:** 2026-06-16.
**Previous:** `handOffs/hand-off-203.md` (S198 CLOSE — WRAPPED + PUSHED).
**Next-session pickup:** rotate THIS file → `handOffs/hand-off-204.md` at next OPEN.
**Profile:** A — FULL.
**Closed via the FIRST live baton-pass:** a warm vPA (booted off `vpa.md` mid-S199) absorbed the S199 `handOffs/delta-log.md` through the baton entry **[17]**, assumed PA authority, and ran this 8-step wrap **WARM** — no cold wrap+restart. The outgoing PA stood down. This fat hand-off persists for cold-start safety + audit (the delta-log is what the next vPA absorbs).

## ⚡ THE BIG ONE — S200 = repo rename (do FIRST next session; user-chosen timing)
`scrml` → **`scrml-native`** (pure self-host) AND `scrmlTS` → **`scrml`** (the working compiler becomes the public canonical name — points at the artifact adopters use through v1.0; `-native` names the self-host). **Big careful sweep — SCOPE FIRST. Do NOT do mid-session or with an agent in flight.** Targets: home-dir paths (`/home/bryan-maclee/scrmlMaster/scrmlTS` → `.../scrml`), git remotes, `pa.md` + `pa-core-scrmlTS.md` + `vpa-scrmlTS.md` + primer + master-list + PA memory + hand-off cross-refs, dropbox outbox paths, the S100 path-discipline hook (hardcodes `scrmlTS`), agent-brief absolute paths, resource-maps, `.claude/worktrees/` paths. User (S199): *"session 200 would be great for the name change."*

## Session-close state (verified)
- **HEAD:** `wrap(s199)` (this wrap commit) — **pushed to origin**. Substantive landings this session: E-leg `2e3aa6a4` · HOS showcase `4f6aa2e8` · gap-184 `d6608255` · each-gap `76d03aa9`.
- **Sync:** scrmlTS pushed (pre-wrap was 0/2 unpushed — `d6608255` + `76d03aa9` — landed + pushed with the wrap). scrml-support pushed (NEW `vpa-scrmlTS.md` + pa.md S199 baton addendum + user-voice S199). Both clean, 0/0.
- **Board:** **HIGH 3 · MED 11 · LOW 20 · Nominal 8.** (S198 close was HIGH 2 · MED 10 · LOW 20 · Nominal 8; S199 added +1 HIGH `g-each-component-body-invalid-js` and +1 MED `g-colon-shorthand-markup-misparse`.)
- **Tests:** full suite **24,372 / 0** (at E-leg/HOS); pre-commit subset **17,219 / 0** (gap-184/each-gap). No compiler source changed after HOS `4f6aa2e8` (gap-184 + each-gap + wrap are docs-only) → full suite unchanged through close; pre-push hook is the gate.
- **Maps:** REFRESHED to watermark **`76d03aa9`** (was stale at `471cbb34`) via `project-mapper` incremental on the E-leg/HOS source surface (engine/codegen/symbol-table/dependency-graph/runtime).
- **Inbox:** empty. **Worktrees:** main only (E-leg agent worktree `agent-a3eafd6196921f173` cleaned at 6b — its Phase 0/1 commits were subsumed by the PA-direct landing `2e3aa6a4`).
- **Experts staged** (`~/.claude/agents/`): `xstate-expert` · `elm-architecture-expert` · `threejs-webgl-integration-expert`.
- **Version:** v0.7.0.

## What landed S199 (detail)

**1. E-leg — `<engine for=T server=@source>` server-authoritative hydration (`2e3aa6a4`, pushed).**
The engine HYDRATES guard-free from a server-owned SOURCE cell (via `_scrml_engine_hydrate_init`, reused from the S198 `initial=@cell` F-primitive), reactively, whenever the source resolves/changes; CLIENT writes stay GUARDED (`_scrml_engine_direct_set`) — source-subscription is the ONLY guard-free path. `server=@source` = §52 *authority* sense (NOT the deprecated fn-placement sense). The engine rides an existing server source's §52 load (fetch-on-mount + SSR pre-render); it does NOT self-load. +18 unit tests (`engine-hydration-server-source.test.js`); full suite 24,372/0; R26-verified (bare-root + field-access); S147 coherence clean. **Supersedes `g-engine-server-flag-silent-swallow` for the `=@source` form** (bare no-value `<engine server>` stays resolved-wrong/out-of-scope). The re-dispatch crashed on a transient env-500 after committing Phase 0+1 (3rd dispatch-path crash this arc — NOT PA-loop); PA-direct finished Phase 2-4 (user: *"PA-direct, go"*). DD `scrml-support/docs/deep-dives/engine-hydration-from-persisted-state-2026-06-15.md`; design-insight recorded.

**2. HOS engine showcase (`4f6aa2e8`, pushed)** — the canonical engine example the S193 MMORPG/"engines-everywhere" reframe asked for (S198's 1b removed the dead HOS engine and deferred the showcase to the E-leg). Trucking `pages/driver/hos.scrml` + `components/driver-card.scrml` now use `server=@currentDriver.current_status`; the engine renders the current-status badge + hydrates `@driverStatus`; `rule=` = the HOS transitions; buttons read `@driverStatus`. Within-node `hos` re-baselined; trucking +`W-ENGINE-SERVER-SOURCE-NOT-AUTHORITATIVE:1`. **E-leg→showcase arc CLOSED.**

**3. gap-184 a+b (`d6608255`, was unpushed → pushed with wrap)** — kickstarter §11.1 flagship engine recipe MODERNIZED (bare-body + typed `Loaded(rows: Row[])` payload + `<each>`; compiles clean) + filed **`g-colon-shorthand-markup-misparse`** (MED — the underlying BS `:`-shorthand-markup mis-parse that surfaces a misleading `E-STRUCTURAL-ELEMENT-MISPLACED` cascade). State regen +1 MED.

**4. `<each>` corpus sweep → `g-each-component-body-invalid-js` (HIGH, `76d03aa9`, was unpushed → pushed with wrap)** — `<each>` over a COMPONENT-list (`<LoadCard>`) loses component scope (E-SCOPE-001) + emits invalid JS (E-CODEGEN-INVALID-JS); the board conversion was REVERTED (blocked); plain-HTML `<each>` works.

**5. flogeance / vPA continuity workflow built (the workflow-meta thread).** The maturation/baton-pass PA-continuity system attacking the ~280k cold-start tax. Landed: the new private **flogeance** repo (built in scrml — itself a dogfood; scrmlTS *consumes* it) SCAFFOLDED (git init + project pa.md + README + `docs/ideas.md` + dropbox; committed local `d846fec`, **NO remote — user adds**), then REFRAMED → **MPA** (Master PA Orchestrator) with a 6-DD slate authored (vPA) in `flogeance/docs/ideas.md`; the vPA role directive `scrml-support/vpa-scrmlTS.md` (sibling to pa.md; boot-hardened so the `delta-log` WINS over hand-off/master-list on conflict — entries [9][12]); the pa.md S199 baton-pass addendum (PA side); the `handOffs/delta-log.md` PA→vPA stream + format ratified (raw-stream-only, PA single-writer); the `scrmlTS/vpa.md` boot pointer (*"read vpa.md and boot"*). **This wrap is the FIRST live baton-pass — executed WARM by the successor.**

## ⏭️ OPEN THREADS / NEXT PRIORITIES

1. **S200 repo rename** (see THE BIG ONE above) — the explicit next-session arc.
2. **3 fresh-arc compiler bugs** (BS/codegen — "delicate, fresh-arc-shaped per the repeated-crash pattern + S140 PA-direct-during-instability lesson). These are the remaining high-value scrml-correctness work:
   - `g-each-component-body-invalid-js` (**HIGH**) — `<each>` over a component-list loses component scope (E-SCOPE-001) + emits invalid JS.
   - `g-markup-value-ternary-fnreturn-codegen` (**HIGH**, pre-existing, S197) — markup-as-value (Pillar 1) fails to codegen in 3 documented forms (inline ternary `${c ? <a/> : <b/>}` · derived-cell ternary · `fn f() -> markup { return <m/> }`). Blocks the deferred `32-markup-as-value` example.
   - `g-colon-shorthand-markup-misparse` (**MED**) — BS `:`-shorthand-markup mis-parse → misleading `E-STRUCTURAL-ELEMENT-MISPLACED`.
3. **flogeance / MPA** — the vPA workflow REFRAMED → Master PA Orchestrator; a 6-DD slate is authored in `flogeance/docs/ideas.md`. flogeance is **LOCAL-ONLY** (commit `d846fec`, no remote — user adds it). **flogeance is where the user discusses remaining workflow ideas** (more not yet shared). The PA↔vPA system itself is now LIVE + proven (this session's baton-pass).
4. **Trucking corpus rewrite continues** (the S193 "show real scrml" arc; HOS engine showcase now done): slices 2-5 — decl-coupled validators · `<each>` sweep · errors-as-states · typed props.

## Carried backlog (lower priority)
- Trucking slices 2-5 + remaining corpus-rewrite waves.
- Wave-3 deferred `32-markup-as-value` (blocked on `g-markup-value-ternary-fnreturn-codegen` HIGH).
- Gauntlet measurement; value-native map §59 phase-c build (Nominal); the broader §59/Nominal-spec-ahead slate (8 Nominal entries).

## The vPA / flogeance workflow — now LIVE (orientation for the next vPA)
The model (see `scrml-support/vpa-scrmlTS.md` + `handOffs/delta-log.md` header): the vPA boots ONCE (full PA-style start, overlapped with PA productivity), then stays current by absorbing the PA's `delta-log` on poke (NOT re-reading docs), and **takes the baton** when the PA nears wrap. Rolling baton: vPA → PA → (fresh) vPA. **Single-writer rule:** only the LIVE PA commits/appends-to-delta-log; the vPA is read-only until the baton-pass. The delta-log is ephemeral-per-baton-cycle, raw-stream-only, and WINS over this hand-off on conflict (the hand-off only rewrites at wrap). S199 proved the loop end-to-end: a vPA booted mid-session, absorbed through [11], then through the baton [17], and ran this wrap as the new PA.
