# scrml — Session 350 (bryan · ASUS-Vivobook) — WRAP

**Date:** 2026-08-17 → 08-19. `/boot recover unwrapped session`, Profile A. Booted as the recovery
successor to **S349-bryan, which died unwrapped**. **S351-peter ran concurrently** and landed 3 fixes
+ continuity (#560/#561/#562/#563); this wrap merges his work rather than replacing it.

**Nothing of mine is on `main` except this continuity PR.** Four arcs are complete-and-held, all
pushed, none landed. That is a choice, not a stall — three of the four are held by a *ruling*, not by
engineering.

## ⏭ NEXT-SESSION PICKUP (read this FIRST)

### 1. ⭐ THE SESSION'S REAL FINDING: the bottleneck is DELIVERY, not deliberation

**Five instances in one day of FINISHED work that no probe read.** This is the forest; everything
else is trees.

| finished work | filed where | read by | lost |
|---|---|---|---|
| Peter's dpa-030 OQ-2 (4th ingress door) | inbox memo | nothing | 2d |
| scrml-site's soft-nav HIGH bug report | a git branch | nothing on `main` | 1d |
| the PA's own dpa-033 | delta-log | not the dPA queue | same-session |
| **the sliding-doors audit's #1 rec (R5)** | `rulings-pending/` | nothing | **3d** |
| `dpa-029-Q1-egress-envelope.md` | `rulings-pending/` | nothing | **2d** |

bryan asked whether he'd ever seen the sliding-doors results. **He had not — they exist and are
good** (`scrml-support/docs/audits/sliding-doors-corpus-zero-2026-08-16/GRAPH.md`: 324 sites → ~37
decisions, ranked R1-R7). The audit's own "Next" said *bring bryan R5*. It sat three days.

**Two probes now exist for this** (branch `runtime-size-and-probes`, NOT landed): `inbox-stranded.ts`
and `ruling-debt.ts`, both registered in `boot.ts`, both bite-proven two-sided. **They are RED today
over real backlog (3 stranded messages, 1 unqueued ruling) — drain them at the next landing or they
decay into wallpaper (§8).**

### 2. ⭐ SIX dPA ADVISORIES AWAIT bryan — 0 UNRUN, all ran, none ratified

`dpa-022 · 024 · 029 · 032 · 033 · 034`. Per S346 cadence: surface ONE in depth, rule, bank, next.
**Do NOT rule 022/024 cold** (stale premises). The two freshest:

- **dpa-033** — `reveal` on raw egress. **The Rule 4 gate DISSOLVED most of this item:** §14.8.9
  (`SPEC.md:8506-8513`) already mandates VALUE-scoped declassification in four phrases (*at the
  value* · *here only* · *declassified-at-this-value* · *at the sink*), so the implementation's
  body/closure-wide `revealed` union is the NON-CONFORMANT state and tightening it is a **bug fix**,
  not an amendment. **One bounded question remains:** is `reveal`-on-raw-egress a spelling scrml keeps
  at all, or does raw egress become a place protected columns cannot go? Migration measured: `.reveal(`
  in exactly **2** `.scrml` files, both dedicated conformance cases.
- **dpa-034** — editions. ⚠ **TWO artifacts exist** (a PA scheduling error — the PA fired a lane on an
  item already in the dPA drain path). Neither supersedes the other; consolidate after the ruling.
  ★★ **The audit's headline argument is measurably FALSE and four artifacts propagated it:**
  `gh issue list --state all` → three authors all time, **`#471` and `Peter` are the SAME person
  (`pjoliver11`)**. The two-friends premise is **CONFIRMED, not falsified** — strike it for being the
  WRONG KIND of reason (S346), not for being stale. Also: the PA's own "re-earn on Go/C++ `-std=`"
  rec is **self-undermining** (both ARE coexistence mechanisms); §62 is **100% unbuilt**; and the
  no-editions lifecycle **already ran end-to-end via `<machine>` and worked**.

### 3. Four arcs complete + held, all pushed, none landed

| branch | SHA | state | blocked on |
|---|---|---|---|
| `soft-nav-head-sync` | `f4529dd5` | **complete, red-before-green proven (7 of 9 fail unfixed, 10/10 fixed)** | **its S239 pass** |
| `egress-tojson-root` | `eb170a84` | 3 fail-opens closed; **1 residual fail-open** | **dpa-033 ruling** + M4 |
| `comment-token-fix-r1` | `67ad4e05` | **DO-NOT-LAND** — S239 found a HIGH regression | fix round |
| `runtime-size-and-probes` | `5a8f2375` | complete (measurement + 2 probes) | PA review |

Plus `dtr-r7` `152dfa47` — DO-NOT-LAND until comment-tokens land.

### 4. ⭐ The 16 KB budget: the fork is asked about a number that doesn't measure the thing

**Two independent measurements converged on this.** The gate exists
(`v0-3-x-spa-tree-shake-phase-b.test.js:145`, pre-commit) — **and its `SPA_COUNTER` fixture has no
`<program>`/`<outlet>`, so it never assembles the chunk where the soft-nav engine lives.**

- gated artifact: **15,600 B** (784 B margin — recorded 127 B was stale by 6×)
- `<program>`+`<outlet/>` shell, **what scrml.dev ships**: **28,190 B = 1.72× budget, before any fix**
- TodoMVC runtime: **44,557 B — 28 KB over**

**bryan's third path is right, but via the other lever:** name-shortening saves **245 B (1.6%)**;
**comment-stripping saves 9,843 B (63.1%)** — 49.1% of the shipped core runtime is compiler-maintainer
prose going into end users' browsers, with **zero** `@license`/`@preserve`/sourcemap pragmas, so
removal is provably inert. **Recommendation: DROP name-shortening (not defer); comment-strip
production-only, core runtime only.** Owed before building: a real Chromium run (S265).

### 5. Owed to scrml-site — ours to unblock

scrml.dev runs `hard` on **all 551 internal `<a>`** purely to work around the soft-nav defect. They
committed to reverting the day it lands and asked to be pinged on their inbox. An ack is delivered
(`scrml-site` `6f30344`); **the ping is still owed.**

## ⚑ MISSES (mine, recorded because they will recur)

1. **★ I banked a false mechanism as fact within minutes.** Work vanished during a commit; I had a
   clean reproducer and a plausible cause, and wrote *"the pre-commit hook is destructive when
   interrupted"* into the ledger. **It was a concurrent review agent** that ran `git checkout <branch>
   -- .` in the MAIN checkout and restored with `reset && checkout HEAD`. The hook is exonerated. It
   also explains the full-suite run (~28 modified files defeated the docs-only detector). Caught ONLY
   because the agent self-disclosed — I had no probe. **The empirical-sufficiency illusion applied to a
   friction report.** [1568] left in place as superseded; the misattribution IS the lesson.
2. **★ I told a dispatch "no gate enforces the budget" as fact.** It does, and `known-gaps.md` names
   the exact file:line. I grepped `16384` and missed `16 * 1024`.
3. **★ I propagated the `#471`-falsifies-two-friends claim** into a bank entry without checking. One
   command refuted it. I was the fourth hop of a laundering trace.
4. **★ I duplicated dpa-034** by firing a lane on an item already in the dPA's drain path — didn't
   check before spending it.
5. **★ My own soft-nav "delivery" was incomplete** — moved to `read/` on an unlanded branch, so it read
   as handled while `main` had it nowhere. A fix that lives only on a branch is not a delivery.
6. Raised a context floor at "88%" when we were at 77%. bryan's budget signals are authoritative.

## 🧷 STATE

- **main** `70eef677`; this branch merges it (0 behind). Cloud `gate` GREEN.
- Gaps: **HIGH 46 · MED 150 · LOW 69 · NOMINAL 1**. Review floor **0 OWED** (Peter drained it).
- dPA: **34 queued · 0 UNRUN · 6 ADVISORY**. corpus-zero: 2 OWED (bryan's).
- **Delta-log numbering collided THREE times** — with S351-peter twice and with the **dPA writing
  into the PA's checked-out branch**. Resolved to an unbroken `1537`-`1576`. *The sequence is a shared
  mutable counter with no allocation mechanism; it will collide again. Cheap fix: per-session prefixes.*
- **`git gc` is failing repo-wide** (`bad tree object fb316444…`, unreachable from any ref) — every
  ref verifies, no work at risk, but auto-repack never runs and the object store will grow.
- Pre-existing delta-log duplicate at `[1524]`/`[1525]`, from before this session.
