# generated-at: 8e278c73 — **THE SAME SHA AS LINE 3, BY CONSTRUCTION.** At this watermark
# `merge-base HEAD origin/main` == `origin/main` == `8e278c73`. ⚠ **`HEAD` is NOT equal to it this
# pass** — it is `a97766fc`, a LOCAL, UNPUSHED commit on branch `maps/s395-tail` carrying this pass's
# own map tail, with a `--name-only` EMPTY source delta. The watermark deliberately tracks the
# merge-base, NOT `HEAD`: stamping an unpushed branch tip is the S326/S328/S331 orphaned-stamp hazard.
# MAP-STAMP RULE run at WRITE time, all three commands:
# `BASE=$(git merge-base HEAD origin/main)` -> `8e278c73`; `git diff --name-only BASE..HEAD --
# compiler/ scripts/ conformance/ stdlib/ lsp/ .github/ package.json` -> **EMPTY**;
# `git merge-base --is-ancestor 8e278c73 origin/main` -> **exit 0**. Inbound check (invariant 48) also
# run: `git merge-base --is-ancestor ad7b65dc 8e278c73` -> exit 0.
#
# ━━━━━━━ S396 wrap-6c — **STAMP ADVANCED. `ad7b65dc` -> `8e278c73`.** ━━━━━━━
#
# ⚠ **TWO SHAs, AND THE DISTINCTION IS LOAD-BEARING — DO NOT COLLAPSE THEM.** The **SOURCE DELTA**
# this pass walked is `ad7b65dc..2d8dd8cb` (7 commits, 4 changed source files). The **WATERMARK** is
# `8e278c73`, which is further along: `2d8dd8cb..8e278c73` is the wrap commit (#824) and is
# `--name-only` **EMPTY** over `compiler/ scripts/ conformance/ stdlib/ lsp/ .github/ package.json`.
# Every measurement below therefore holds at the watermark unchanged — the stamp is advanced to the
# CURRENT `origin/main` rather than left on the last source-bearing commit, because the MAP-STAMP
# RULE takes the merge-base, not the last interesting commit.
#
# **THE COMPLETE SOURCE DELTA WAS WALKED, SO THE PARTIAL-PASS RULE IS SATISFIED RATHER THAN WAIVED.**
# `git diff --name-only ad7b65dc..2d8dd8cb` over `compiler/src` · `compiler/native-parser` · `stdlib` ·
# `scripts` · `lsp` · `conformance` is **FOUR source files**, and every one was read in full:
#   · `compiler/src/route-inference.ts` + `compiler/src/codegen/collect.ts` — **#818** (`c4c55c50`)
#   · `conformance/normalize.ts` — **#822** (`ae2741e7`)
#   · `compiler/src/commands/dev.js` — **#823** (`2d8dd8cb`)
# Also in the window: 3 test files changed, **2 NEW conformance cases**, and `docs/FACTS.md`.
# `.github/` is `--name-only` **EMPTY**, so `ci.yml` is byte-identical and the blocking `gate` job is
# FLAT at **14 total steps (12 `- name:` + 2 `- uses:`)** — stated both ways deliberately, because
# "14" and "12" are each correct under a different counting base and a bare number invites the
# ambiguity. Re-counted at this SHA by parse, not carried.
#
# **NO CONFIG-KEY CHANGE THIS WINDOW.** No `.env` template, no `package.json`, and no `config.*` module
# changed between `ad7b65dc` and `2d8dd8cb`. Carried forward VERIFIED-UNCHANGED.
#

No `.env.example` or `.env.template` in the repo. No `.env*` files were read (per config-map policy, `.env*` files other than `.env.example`/`.env.template` are never read by this mapper).

**Re-verified at `e80b692e` (S313)** by re-enumerating every `process.env.*` / `Bun.env.*` reference across `compiler/src`, `lsp`, `scripts` and `e2e`. **The compiler-side set is UNCHANGED across five sessions** — every landing in this window was compiler source, spec, CI or docs; none introduced or removed a configuration key. The CI-secret table at the bottom is the only part of this map that moved.

## Environment Variables (referenced directly in compiler/src / lsp / scripts / e2e source)

| Key | Where used | Notes |
|-----|-----------|-------|
| NODE_ENV | compiler/src/ | runtime environment detection |
| PORT | compiler/src/ | HTTP server port (generated-app server + `scrml serve`) |
| SCRML_PORT | compiler/src/ | scrml dev-server port override |
| SCRML_MCP_WATCH | compiler/src/ | enables MCP file-watch mode |
| CI | e2e/playwright.config.ts, e2e/playwright.docs.config.ts | gates retries/workers/reporter/reuseExistingServer for CI vs local runs |
| REDIS_TEST_URL | compiler/tests/unit/stdlib-redis.test.js | optional — enables the live-integration redis test tier (skipped by default / in CI) |

**Correction vs. the prior watermark:** `JWT_SECRET` was previously listed as a compiler-read env var; verified this pass that it is NOT read via `process.env` anywhere in compiler/src or compiler/runtime — it appears only in a JSDoc `@example` comment in `stdlib/auth/jwt.scrml` illustrating how a CONSUMER app might supply its own secret. `signJwt`/`verifyJwt` take `secret` as a caller-supplied function argument; this compiler repo has no env-var-based JWT secret of its own.

Generated (emitted) apps additionally read author-declared env vars via `<db src=env(...)>` / `scrml:host` — those are per-app, not part of this compiler repo's own config surface, and are not enumerated here.

## Feature Flags
No runtime feature-flag system. The native-parser is activated at CLI level via `--parser=scrml-native` (canary mode, not an env var). `--emit-block-analysis`, `--emit-engine-graph`, `--emit-token-set` are compile-time diagnostic-emission CLI flags (see build.map.md).

## `compilerSettings` — the SPEC §28 `lint.*` suppression knobs (an API option, NOT env vars)
`compileScrml({ compilerSettings: { … } })` accepts a small, closed set of lint-suppression keys.
They mirror the spec-only `lint.*` config family at SPEC §28; **unknown keys are silently ignored**,
and there is no config FILE loader in this repo — an adopter's own project loader passes the object.

| Key | Values | Default | Suppresses |
|---|---|---|---|
| `lintTailwindUnrecognizedClass` | `"warn"` / `"off"` | `"warn"` | `W-TAILWIND-UNRECOGNIZED-CLASS` — for codebases relying on custom CSS class names, where the lint produces acknowledged false positives (SPEC §26.5 / §34) |
| `lintForeignUndeclaredCapability` | fires / `"off"` | fires | `W-FOREIGN-UNDECLARED-CAPABILITY` — the §23.5.5 presence-nudge, for an author who genuinely wants an undeclared foreign scope |

Declared at `compiler/src/api.js` (~:751-766); read at ~:1039. See error.map.md for both codes.

## Runtime constants in the emitted client (compile-time literals, NOT config)
`_SCRML_NAV_CHUNK_TIMEOUT_MS` — the cross-chunk soft-nav script-load budget before falling back to a
hard navigation (`W-NAV-CHUNK-LOAD-FAILED`, §20.8.2/§20.8.7). Baked into `runtime-template.js`; not
author-settable and not an env var. Likewise the DB-authoritative GUC names (`scrml.tenant`,
`scrml.principal.caps`) and role/policy names (`scrml_app`, `scrml_tenant_iso`) are exported string
CONSTANTS in `schema-differ.js`, not configuration.

## Config Files

### bunfig.toml  [repo root]
`[test]` section: test root = `compiler/tests/` — **and deliberately NO `timeout` key (#537, S346).**
The file carried `timeout = 10000` from the initial split until S346 and **bun does not read
`[test].timeout`** — the effective per-test budget was always bun's default **5000 ms**. ⚠ The prior
generation of this map printed `timeout = 10000ms` as if it were live configuration; **that claim was
wrong at every stamp that carried it**, not merely stale. The standing rule (stated in the file
itself): a test/hook that legitimately runs multi-second declares its own budget at the site
(`test(name, fn, { timeout })` / `beforeAll(fn, { timeout })`) with a comment saying why; the only
per-run knob is the CLI flag `bun test --timeout <ms>`. **Do NOT re-add a key to widen the default
silently** — `scripts/browser-baseline.ts` gates on the browser tier's failure NAME SET, and a
timed-out test produces the same `(fail) <name>` marker as a failed assertion.

### compiler/src/unit-cc-exemption-list.json
List of unit-test files exempted from code-coverage enforcement (currently empty array).

### compiler/tests/parser-conformance-within-node-allowlist.json
Per-file allowlist of native-parser-vs-live-pipeline within-node divergence counts (COUNT-LENGTH / EXTRA-FIELD / FIELD-SHAPE buckets), maintained per GITI-024 shape-change tracking.

## CI Secrets (GitHub Actions repo secrets, NOT env vars in source — names only)
| Secret | Consumed by | Status |
|---|---|---|
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | **`advisory-review.yml` ONLY, and that workflow is `workflow_dispatch`-only as of #351. `cloud-maps.yml` no longer references it at all — Stage 2 was DELETED.** | **CHANGED — treat as UNSET / not-required.** bryan ruled the cloud AI spend OFF; **the absence is a COST decision, not a broken secret**, and both consuming legs were removed rather than left permanently red (the `pa-base` §8 cry-wolf shape). **Every prior map generation's "IS set — the daily cloud-maps run passes it" note is RETIRED**, as is the credential/entitlement diagnosis of the old cloud-maps red. To reinstate either leg: set the secret AND restore the trigger/step. See build.map.md. |
| `MAPS_PAT` | `cloud-maps.yml` checkout token + `GH_TOKEN` for the PR/auto-merge step | Set. A fine-grained PAT (Contents R/W + Pull-requests R/W). Required INSTEAD of `GITHUB_TOKEN` because a `GITHUB_TOKEN`-opened PR does not cascade events and `gate` would never fire. **Expires (≤1 yr) — renew or the bot goes dark.** |

`cloud-maps.yml` also DROPPED its `id-token: write` permission — it existed solely for the removed
claude-code-action's OIDC.

**Operational consequence that belongs in a config map, not just a build map: nothing on a schedule
consumes an AI credential in this repo any more, and nothing on a schedule refreshes `.claude/maps/`.
A map stamp is now exactly as old as the last PA wrap.**

No secret VALUE appears anywhere in this map set.
