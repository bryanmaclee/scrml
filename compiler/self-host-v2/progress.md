# self-host-v2 LEXER — slice 1 (Road-B compiler impl#2, S234)

Home: `compiler/self-host-v2/` (fresh dedicated area — NOT native-parser, NOT a port).
Design authority: `scrml-support/docs/deep-dives/compiler-reimagining-lexer-slice-2026-06-26.md`
(Approach B: pure `fn lex(src) -> Token[]` folding `step(st) -> LexState` over `match (mode, event)`).

## Slice-1 scope (built here)
- Shared substrate: TokenKind (payload enum) · QuoteKind/BracketKind · Span/Token/Cursor/Scan structs ·
  makeCursor/peekCode/advance/isEof · char-class fns · regexAllowedAfter.
- Lex-fold skeleton: LexMode + LexEvent enums · LexState struct · classify · step (`match (mode,event)`) ·
  lex driver (`while (!isEof) st = step(st)`).
- CORE-TOKEN scanners: scanIdentOrKeyword · scanNumber · scanOperatorOrPunct (+ munchEq/munchBang/munchLt/munchGt).

## DEFERRED to later slices (routed to a total stub arm; NOT scanned this slice)
- strings (scanString / QuoteKind bodies)         — slice-2
- template-interp nesting (InTemplateBody + `${}`) — slice-2/3
- line + block comments (`//`, `/*`)               — slice-2
- regex bodies (`/.../flags`)                      — slice-3
- BracketStack + ErrorRecovery threading           — later (fields not in slice-1 LexState)
In `step`, every non-`(InCode, Ordinary|SawEof)` event routes to `deferAdvance` (advances 1 char, emits
no token) so the fold stays TOTAL. The slice-1 corpus contains none of these, so the stub never fires.

## THE ORACLE (token-diff, loop-until-green)

### Reference = impl#1 lexer (`compiler/native-parser/lex.js`)
`lex(source)` → `Token[]`, each `{ kind:string, text:string, span:{start,end,line,col} }`.
Phase-0 characterization (probed live against native-parser/lex.js):
- Whitespace + newline trivia are SKIPPED (not emitted).
- Keywords are DISTINCT kinds (`const`->`KwConst`, `let`->`KwLet`, ...); operators maximal-munched
  (`===`->StrictEqual, `!==`->StrictNotEqual, `<=`->LessEqual, `++`->Increment, `??`->NullishCoalesce,
  `?.`->OptionalChain); `NumberLit` carries raw text; `EOF` token at end (empty text, span `[len,len]`).

### Candidate = impl#2 (`compiler/self-host-v2/lex.scrml`)
Compiled via the LIVE compiler (`<program>` browser mode → `<base>.client.js`), then the emitted
`_scrml_lex_N(src)` is discovered by regex + called via `new Function(clientText + "return <fn>;")()`.
Only runtime helper referenced by the pure lexer = `_scrml_structural_eq` (from `==`); the oracle
provides a compact deep-equal stub. NO reactive/runtime/DOM deps (pure fold).

### Normalization (both sides -> `{kind, text, start, end}`)
- kind tag: `typeof k === "object" ? k.variant : k` (payload variant -> `{variant,data}`; nullary -> string).
- impl#2 nullary kinds are NAMED to match impl#1 exactly (LParen/Plus/StrictEqual/NumberLit/Ident/...).
- KEYWORD collapse: any impl#1 `Kw*` kind AND impl#2 `Keyword` -> canonical `"KW"`; the `text` field
  (compared too) discriminates the specific keyword. Low-coupling: no mirroring of impl#1's per-keyword
  table (D3: token taxonomy is impl freedom; the wave oracle is allowlisted/normalized).
- `Eof`/`EOF` -> `"EOF"`.
Diff compares the 4-tuple per token. Divergence on the slice-1 subset = RED.

### Corpus subset (slice-1 only: idents / keywords / numbers / operators / punctuation)
A curated in-test array of slice-1-only snippets (NO strings/comments/regex/templates, since deferred).
Rationale: real corpus `case.scrml` sources almost all contain deferred token classes; a curated subset
is the defensible slice-1 diff surface (the brief's "SMALL corpus subset restricted to slice-1 tokens").

## DOGFOOD FINDINGS (live compiler bugs / gaps surfaced building slice 1)

**F1 (PRIMARY) — library mode cannot lower the flagship idiom.**
A bare `${...}` exports-only module compiles in library mode (SPEC §21.5), but the library emitter
(`compiler/src/codegen/emit-library.ts`) is a SHALLOW REGEX-TRANSFORM over raw source text: it strips
`type` decls + rewrites `fn`->`function` + `not`/`is`, but does NOT (a) strip type annotations on
params/returns/locals [`fn f(n: int) -> int` leaks `: int`/`-> int` verbatim -> E-CODEGEN-INVALID-JS],
(b) lower `match`, (c) lower payload-variant construction. So idiomatic scrml (typed payloads + match-fold)
does NOT compile as an importable library module. Only the `<program>` (browser) path routes through the
real AST emitter (emit-logic/emit-expr) that lowers these. => slice-1 WORKAROUND: wrap the lexer in
`<program>` and consume the emitted client.js. Repro: `${ export fn dbl(n: int) -> int { return n*2 } }`
(no `<program>`) -> E-CODEGEN-INVALID-JS; same body inside `<program>` -> clean.
IMPLICATION FOR ROAD-B: the reimagined compiler must emit library modules through the real emitter, or
a scrml-native library (the compiler's own modules!) can't use typed payloads + match. This is the single
biggest structural blocker for "the compiler is written in idiomatic scrml as importable modules."

**F2 — int-literal `match` arms break the parser + emit invalid JS.**
`match n { 61 :> "eq"  40 :> "lp"  _ :> "other" }` -> `[scrml] warning: statement boundary not detected`
+ E-CODEGEN-INVALID-JS (`const _scrml_match = n; else return "other";` — the int-literal arms are DROPPED,
leaving a bare `else`). STRING-literal match arms (`match s { "if" :> 1 ... }`) compile clean.
=> The DD's Approach-B `scanOperatorOrPunct` design (`match peekCode(cur,0){ 61 :> munchEq(...) ... }`)
does NOT compile. slice-1 dispatches operators on the 1-CHAR STRING instead
(`const ch: string = ...; match ch { "=" :> ... }`) — cleaner/more-readable anyway.

**F3 — product-match drops an arm carrying a literal (int) pattern in a tuple slot.**
`match (a, b) { (.LParen, 0) :> "lp0"  (.Num(v,r), _) :> "num"  (_,_) :> "other" }` -> the `(.LParen, 0)`
arm is SILENTLY DROPPED from the lowered JS (only the variant arms emit). enum×enum product-match lowers
correctly. slice-1 `match (mode, event)` is enum×enum (sidesteps F3), but flag it.

**F4 — bare variant resolves ONLY in fn-return position or when qualified.**
`return .Num(v,r)` (fn return type = the enum) RESOLVES. As a fn ARG (`mkTok(.LParen, ...)`), a struct-field
value (`{ kind: .Plus, ... }`), or an array element (`[.LParen]`) it fires E-VARIANT-AMBIGUOUS EVEN with the
target type annotated (the JS lowers correctly to the string tag, but the TYPER rejects it). => slice-1 uses
qualified `TokenKind.X` and typed-return helper fns exclusively.

**F5 — `match` subject must be typed; a `.substring`-derived local is `asIs`.**
`const ch = c.source.substring(...); match ch {...}` -> E-TYPE-025 (asIs subject). Annotate
`const ch: string = ...`. (Host-method return types are `asIs`; annotate to feed the typer.)

**F6 — `match` arms with `|` ALTERNATION drop silently (string + payload variants).**
An alternation arm fails to lower when the alternatives are STRING literals (`"const" | "let" :> true`) OR
when any alternative is a PAYLOAD pattern (`.Ident(_) | .Num(_) :> false`): the arm is dropped, leaving a
bare `else` -> parse desync / E-CODEGEN-INVALID-JS. NULLARY-enum-variant alternation (`.A | .B :> x`) works
(both newline- and comma-separated). => `isKeyword` uses single-literal arms (a lookup table);
`regexAllowedAfter` uses an `is .Variant` chain instead of the DD's payload-wildcard alternation.

**F7 (benign) — W-DEAD-FUNCTION false-positives on `match`-arm-only callees; they are NOT tree-shaken.**
Reachability does not trace calls from inside `match` arm bodies (`"=" :> munchEq(cur)`; `(.InCode,
.Ordinary) :> emitOneToken(st)`), so munch* / emitOneToken / kUnknown warn as "no callers." Codegen KEEPS
them (verified: every fn survives in the emitted client.js), so output is correct — the warning is noise,
not a shake. Still a real RI call-graph gap (match-arm edges) worth closing.

**F8 — whole-file host-method return-type poisoning: `<string>.charCodeAt()` types as `string`.**
`advance` originally reassigned a `let cc` to an anonymous struct literal `{ source: cc.source, ... }`; in
the FULL file (but NOT an isolated repro) the typer then inferred `cc.source.charCodeAt()` — and even
`peekCode(cc,0)` (a `-> int` fn) — as `string`, firing E-EQ-001 on `ch == 10`. Fix: factor a per-char
`advance1(c: Cursor) -> Cursor` with a clean typed param + `isLineFeed(code: int)` helper, so the reassigned
cursor stays `Cursor`-typed via the return annotation. Root cause = reassign-to-anonymous-struct poisons a
string field's host-method return type across functions. Localized; worth a typer follow-up.

Findings F2/F4/F5/F6 are ergonomic-but-workaroundable; F1 is the structural one; F3/F8 are latent
correctness/soundness bugs (silent arm-drop / cross-fn type poisoning) worth their own follow-ups; F7 is
benign noise. All confirmed against the live compiler at this worktree's base SHA (495a041b).

## STATUS — slice 1 COMPLETE (GREEN)
- [x] Phase 0 — oracle characterized + capability-probed (F1-F8 captured).
- [x] substrate + skeleton + scanners (lex.scrml) — compiles clean via the live compiler.
- [x] oracle test (self-host-v2-lexer-slice1.test.js) — 34/34 GREEN, token-parity vs impl#1 on the slice-1 corpus.

Slice-1 corpus GREEN classes: identifiers, keywords (JS_KEYWORDS minus contextual `type`), numbers
(int/decimal/hex/exponent), operators (`= == === =>  ! != !==  < <=  > >=  + ++  - --  ? ?? ?.  && || & |
* / %`), punctuation/brackets, trivia-skipping. Deferred (routed to `deferAdvance`, not scanned): strings,
template-interp, line/block comments, regex bodies + BracketStack/ErrorRecovery threading.

CONSUMED-BY-ORACLE runtime helper: `_scrml_structural_eq` only (deep-equal stub in the test).
Dogfood verdict: the flagship type+match-fold idiom LOWERS CORRECTLY through the real emitter (clean enum
objects + match IIFEs + threaded structs); it does NOT reach the importable library path (F1) — the single
structural blocker for "the compiler as idiomatic-scrml importable modules."
